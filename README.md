# Stacker

Stacker: The Language of Tasks, Patterns, and Intuitive Execution

Final Comprehensive Overview

1. Essence of Stacker

Stacker is an instruction-oriented, task-based, pattern-driven language designed for people who think in direct steps but need the rigor of explicit logic.

It lives at the intersection of:

Decorative Syntax → readable, elegant,user-friendly.

Concise Semantics → minimal, direct, execution-oriented.

Executable Logic → AST nodes are self-evaluating, patterns are self-matching, no passes, no deferred compilation.

Tagline:
“Stacker — The intuitive, task-based language where patterns breathe, stacks grow, and logic flows effortlessly.”

Punchline:
“Write less. Match more. Run instantly.”

2. Core Design Pillars

Instruction-Oriented Execution
Everything runs directly. No deferred stages. AST nodes carry their own execution logic.

Task-Based Structure
Programs are composed of task blocks. The canonical entrypoint is task main:.

Pattern Matching as the Heartbeat
Stacker elevates pattern matching into the central paradigm:

Match on literals, variables, tuples, lists, dicts.

Support for defaults, lazy evaluation, splats, and beanstalking.

Patterns are programs in miniature, destructuring and binding simultaneously.

Zero Pass Philosophy

No AST-to-IR passes.

No codegen stubs.

No placeholder phases.
Execution flows seamlessly from Lexer → Parser → AST → VM.

Human-Readable, Machine-Executable
Stacker is decorative enough to be read like a script, but concise enough to map directly into runtime logic.

3. Language Syntax
3.1 Tasks
task main:
    say "Hello, Stacker!"
end


Entry point is always task main.

Additional tasks may be defined and invoked later.

3.2 Variables
task main:
    let x = 42
    let msg = "Stacker"
    say msg
end


let introduces or rebinds variables.

Variables are strongly dynamic: type is determined at runtime, but bindings are explicit.

3.3 Printing
say expr


Prints any evaluated expression.

Lazy expressions are auto-forced when printed.

3.4 Pattern Matching

The crown jewel of Stacker.

Literal & Wildcard
match 5:
    case 5:
        say "five"
    case _:
        say "other"
end

Variable Binding
match "hi":
    case msg:
        say msg
end

Tuples
match (1,):
    case (a, b=2, c=3):
        say a
        say b
        say c
end

Lists
match [1, 2, 3]:
    case [head, *tail]:
        say head
        say tail
end

Dicts
match {id: 7}:
    case {id, name="Unknown"}:
        say id
        say name
end

Nested Patterns
match {user: {id: 99, info: {name: "Kay"}}}:
    case {user: {id, info: {name}}}:
        say id
        say name
end

Lazy Defaults
match (1,):
    case (a, b=expensive() lazy):
        say a
        say b
end


Lazy defaults delay evaluation until accessed.

3.5 Beanstalking

A poetic construct: auto-iteration expansion.

match [10, 20, 30]:
    case [*bean]:
        chart bean
end


Dash Output:

10
10—20
10—20—30


Tree Output:

└── 10
    └── 20
        └── 30


Beanstalks can appear inside nested patterns too:

match (0, [1, 2, 3]):
    case (x, [*bean]):
        say x
        chart bean tree
end

3.6 Charts
chart xs
chart xs tree


Visualizes values either as dash chains or Unicode trees.

Works for lists, tuples, and dicts.

4. Runtime Model

Lexer → Splits source into tokens.

Parser → Builds AST of tasks, statements, patterns.

VM → Executes AST directly, one node at a time.

Environment

Runtime state is a dict mapping names → values.

Lazy bindings (=expr lazy) are lambdas stored until needed.

5. Virtual Machine

Tasks: registry of named blocks, executed by run_task("main").

Variables: dynamic storage, lazy-aware.

Say: prints values.

Chart: produces ASCII/Unicode visualizations.

Match: executes cases sequentially until one matches.

6. Design Philosophy

Readable yet Precise
Every construct has direct execution semantics.

Pattern-First
Matching is not an add-on but the language’s core syntax.

Zero Passes
Code is the execution. ASTs are alive.

Poetic Pragmatism
Constructs like beanstalking make iteration natural and expressive.

7. Example Programs
Hello World
task main:
    say "Hello, World!"
end

Defaults and Patterns
task main:
    let t = (5,)
    match t:
        case (a, b=42):
            say a
            say b
    end
end

Nested Dict + Chart
task main:
    let obj = {user: {id: 7, profile: {name: "Alice"}}}
    match obj:
        case {user: {id, profile: {name}}}:
            say id
            chart name
    end
end

Beanstalk Visualization
task main:
    let xs = [1, 2, 3]
    match xs:
        case [*bean]:
            chart bean tree
    end
end

8. Comparison with Other Languages

Python: readability + dynamic types, but Stacker puts patterns at the core.

Rust: powerful match syntax, but Stacker emphasizes tasks and zero-pass direct execution.

Haskell: declarative matching, but Stacker keeps imperative clarity.

These acronyms represent different types of assemblers and compilation targets—each with its own ceremonial role in the ritual of code transformation. Here's a breakdown of their meanings and purposes:

🛠️ NASM — Netwide Assembler
Type: Open-source x86 assembler

Syntax: Intel-style

Use Case: Writing low-level assembly for Linux and Windows systems

Strengths:

Lightweight and fast

Popular for bootloaders, OS kernels, and embedded systems

Invocation: nasm -f elf64 source.asm -o output.o

🔧 GAS — GNU Assembler
Type: Part of the GNU Binutils suite

Syntax: AT&T-style (though Intel syntax is supported with flags)

Use Case: Default assembler for GCC; used in Unix-like systems

Strengths:

Tight integration with GCC and GNU toolchain

Supports multiple architectures (x86, ARM, RISC-V)

Invocation: as source.s -o output.o

🧬 MASM — Microsoft Macro Assembler
Type: Proprietary x86 assembler for Windows

Syntax: Intel-style

Use Case: Windows system programming, legacy DOS apps, and educational use

Strengths:

Rich macro support

Integrated with Visual Studio

Supports 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit targets via ml.exe and ml64.exe

Invocation: ml /c /Fooutput.obj source.asm

🌐 WASM — WebAssembly
Type: Portable binary instruction format

Syntax: Stack-based virtual machine (text format: .wat, binary: .wasm)

Use Case: Running high-performance code in browsers and other sandboxed environments

Strengths:

Near-native speed

Language-agnostic (C, Rust, Go, etc.)

Secure and sandboxed

Invocation: Typically compiled via toolchains like Emscripten or Rust’s wasm-pack

Each of these plays a distinct role in the ceremony of compilation—from invoking native spirits of the machine (NASM, GAS, MASM) to summoning portable avatars for the web (WASM). If you’re designing a symbolic overlay for Stacker’s compiler dispatch, these could be your elemental glyphs.

🧰 What Are These?
They’re different tools that help turn your Stacker code into something your computer can actually run. Think of them like translators—each one speaks a different “machine language” depending on where you want your code to live.

🔧 How Stacker Uses Them
The Stacker compiler is smart. It looks at the file type you give it and picks the right translator automatically:

File Type	What It Means	Where It Runs	What Stacker Does
.nasm	NASM (Netwide Assembler)	Linux or Windows	Uses NASM to turn your code into fast, low-level machine instructions
.asm	GAS (GNU Assembler)	Unix systems	Uses GAS to compile your code, or falls back to NASM if needed
.masm	MASM (Microsoft Assembler)	Windows	Uses MASM to build Windows programs, even through Wine if you're on Mac/Linux
.wasm	WASM (WebAssembly)	Web browsers or sandboxed apps	Runs your code in a secure, portable way—great for web-based tools
🧠 Why It Matters
You don’t have to manually choose a compiler—Stacker does it for you.

You can write one ceremonial task in Stacker and run it on different platforms.

It’s part of what makes Stacker feel like a living system: it adapts to the environment and chooses the right ritual to perform.

So in plain terms: Stacker looks at your file, figures out what kind of machine it’s meant for, and uses the right tool to make it run. Like a universal adapter for code.
