📘 Stacker Documentation Blueprint
1. Introduction
What is Stacker?

Stacker is a task-based, instruction-oriented programming language where pattern matching is the beating heart.

Core Tagline:
“Stacker — The intuitive, task-based language where patterns breathe, stacks grow, and logic flows effortlessly.”

Punchline:
“Write less. Match more. Run instantly.”

Philosophy:
Instruction-oriented. Pattern-first. Zero-pass.

2. Quickstart Guide
Install / Run
git clone https://github.com/yourname/stacker
cd stacker
python stacker.py examples/hello.stk

First Program
task main:
    say "Hello, Stacker!"
end

Visual Output Example
task main:
    let xs = [1, 2, 3]
    match xs:
        case [*bean]:
            chart bean tree
    end
end


Output:

Beanstalk Chart (tree):
└── 1
    └── 2
        └── 3

3. Language Reference
Section	Description
Tasks	Entry points, invocation, nesting (task main, subtasks).
Variables	let, rebinding, lazy defaults (=expr lazy).
Pattern Matching	Tuples, lists, dicts, nested, splats, defaults, wildcards.
Beanstalking	Auto-expanding iteration (*bean), poetic output.
Charts	Dash chains (1—2—3) and Unicode tree visualizations.
Say	Printing and forcing lazy values.
4. Runtime Model

Execution Pipeline: Lexer → Parser → AST → VM.

Environment: dictionary-based, lazy-aware, updated by patterns.

Execution Flow: zero-pass, no IR, no stubs — AST nodes execute themselves.

5. Interoperability

Python FFI: embed and call Python functions directly.

JSON-native: dict patterns align with JSON structures.

Future Bridges: C FFI, LLVM backend, export for compiled optimization.

6. Use Cases

Education: teach recursion, destructuring, data structures.

Data Transformation: ETL pipelines, parsing, filtering.

Creative Coding: live beanstalk visualizations, chart art.

Simulation Scripting: orchestrate workflows and experiments.

7. Examples Gallery

Hello World

task main:
    say "Hello, World!"
end


Nested Destructuring

task main:
    let obj = {user: {id: 7, profile: {name: "Alice"}}}
    match obj:
        case {user: {id, profile: {name}}}:
            say id
            say name
    end
end


Beanstalk Visualization

task main:
    let xs = [1, 2, 3]
    match xs:
        case [*bean]:
            chart bean
    end
end


Live Charting

task main:
    let xs = [10, 20, 30]
    chart xs tree
end

8. Design Philosophy

Poetic Pragmatism: constructs like beanstalks turn iteration into art.

Declarative Matching in Imperative Flow: pattern-first, task-oriented.

Symbolic Clarity: code is not only executable but also expressive and visual.
